The Icebergs.
This post is based on Frederic Edwin Church’s The Icebergs painting, from 1861, portrays a series of snow-covered icebergs
that stretch up like massive snowy giants out of the vast depths of the ocean towards the night sky blocking the horizon. 
The small shard of a broken ship mast, lying just above the edge of the freezing waterline, reveals how unlikely it was 
that there were survivors before the ship quickly sunk into the deep dark cold depths of the ocean.  If there was a 
survivor, his panic would have been almost palpable as he landed ashore dripping wet with the wind tearing at his skin, wondering 
in fear how he could have joined this whale hunting expedition only to land at such an isolated spot that provides no protection 
from the wind but blocks a clear view of the open ocean. The tragedy continues as the survivor’s anguish deepens realizing that 
search boats, as unlikely here as on Mars, would be unable to locate him.  One glance at the widespread gloomy mist blocking the 
starry night sky harkens a warning of a freezing unstoppable storm on its way. Looking around for protection from the elements 
would only etch clearer into the survivor’s reality that the lack of frolicking seals, penguins, and fish, demonstrate that 
this bleak environment is incapable of sustaining life. One glance at this painting reveals the survivor’s end, he sat down, stared 
into the otherworldly emptiness, and hoped that the quiet cold emptiness would swallow him up quickly; which no doubt it did.
